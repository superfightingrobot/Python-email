# Python-email
Looking to create an automated email program after my work UPS goes through daily self tests. Need to figure out how to send to external emails like gmail since it is blocked at work and also how to CC and BCC people. New to python so some guidance would work.
The code I have uploaded did work failed to send externally from some reason.
